*** TODO Implementation roadmap

- [ ] Create the meta-estimator;
- [ ] Create a benchmark file using the `Pipeline` with cache -> we need to merge this PR I think;
- [ ] Evaluate a Balanced Random Forest using different under-sampling methods;
- [ ] Evaluate multiple combination of under-sampling and estimator;
- [ ] Store the prediction such that we can easily compute any metric;
- [ ] Choose metrics and plot to show. Probably a win-loss-tie matrix could be nice on the different benchmarks.
